    <h1>Check Console (F12)</h1>
    
    <script>
   <!-- variable -->
   
   let age = 22; 
// <!--  this is variable, JS creates a space in memory like a box for the variable, 
//  now whoever mention age it will be said 22 by the js// -->

 
//  Let vs Constant 

//   Let - The box can hold the different things

 let score = 0;
 console.log(score); // here score is stored as 0

  score = 10;
  console.log(score) // now score is 10 

  score = 20;
  console.log(score) // again changed, the score now becomes 20

  // meaning we can change the value of variable, if we have created variable with a specific value, we can replace it with different value


  // Constant - the box is locked, once it is created we cant reassign the value even after assigning the next value

  const birthYear = 2005;
console.log(birthYear);

birthYear = 2009;
console.log // this is wrong, since we already created constant we cannot rewrite or assign new value on it// error , cannot change

//JS say !! no this box is locked..

// When to use Const then???==================================================
// tips- use const by default - 90%percent of the time

const pi = 3.14159; // never changes
const username = "Niraj"; // stays same
const MaxPlayer = 10; // fixed value


// Use Let only when the value will be changed
let score = 3;  // will increase during the game
let CurrentPage = 1; // will change when user clicks
let isLoggedIn = true ; // changes to false when logged out
let activeStatus = false // changes to true when user is active
